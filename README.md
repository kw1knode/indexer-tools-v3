Indexer tools aims to be the one-stop-shop for indexers that are a part of the Graph Protocol's decentralized network. View allocations via the Allocation Dashboard, filter subgraphs in the Subgraph Dashboard, calculate the effectiveness of potential allocations in the Allocation Wizard, and more to come soon!
